# Changelog

All notable changes to the GPT Project Documentation System will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v1.3.2 (In Progress) - Data Extraction Inconsistencies Fix

### Added
- New data normalization system to standardize field names and values between extraction passes
- Improved post-processing with field validation and quality metrics
- Field-specific extraction enhancements for all core job details
- Data quality scoring system to evaluate extraction completeness
- Testing and validation script for extraction consistency

### Fixed
- Salary extraction now properly captures displayed salary ranges with pattern recognition
- Company and location field mix-ups corrected with improved field detection
- Job type detection enhanced with parenthetical text analysis
- Easy Apply detection now properly identifies Easy Apply buttons and status
- Fixed inconsistent field naming between basic metadata and detailed extraction
- Posted date extraction now captures both original and reposting dates

### Validation Strategy
The extraction fixes were validated using a specialized testing script that:
1. Tests each fix against real LinkedIn job postings with known issues
2. Compares the original extraction with the enhanced extraction
3. Provides side-by-side output for visual verification
4. Captures screenshots for manual verification
5. Prioritizes the most critical fields (Role, Company, Location, Salary)

Each inconsistency was addressed with targeted improvements:
- **Salary Extraction**: Enhanced pattern recognition with multi-stage fallback strategies
- **Company/Location Swap**: Added field verification and characteristic checking
- **Job Type Detection**: Improved parenthetical text extraction and context analysis
- **Easy Apply Status**: Added multiple detection methods with validation
- **Field Normalization**: Implemented post-processing normalization with data quality metrics

## v1.3.1 (2024-04-28) - Authentication State Transfer Fix

### Added
- Cookie-based authentication state transfer between browser contexts
- Authentication verification for new browser contexts
- Fallback to file-based auth state when cookies aren't provided
