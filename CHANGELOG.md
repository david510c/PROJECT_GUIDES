## Version Update Protocol

When updating this CHANGELOG:

1. Add a new version section at the top (below Unreleased)
2. Include a concise single-line summary of key changes
3. Categorize all changes using standard section headers:
   - Added: New features
   - Changed: Updates to existing functionality
   - Deprecated: Features that will be removed in upcoming releases
   - Removed: Features that were removed
   - Fixed: Bug fixes
   - Security: Security improvements or vulnerability fixes
4. Reference any relevant issue numbers or technical decisions
5. Include migration guidance for breaking changes

The GPT will automatically output a single-line notification when the CHANGELOG is updated:

```
[PROJECT] vX.Y.Z: Single-line summary of changes
```

This changelog is automatically synchronized with implementation records and session continuity documentation.

Note: By default, automatic changelog updates are disabled to reduce context overhead. Use "enable changelog updates" to turn on automatic updates or "update changelog with: [VERSION] [DESCRIPTION]" for one-time updates.
