  identifyRelationships(elements: ContextElement[]): Relationship[];
  
  // Calculates information density of context sections
  calculateDensity(section: ContextSection): number;
  
  // Identifies the most important elements in the context
  extractCoreElements(analysis: ContextAnalysis): ContextElement[];
