# GPT Project Documentation System

## Overview

A comprehensive documentation system designed to enhance collaboration between humans and GPT agents during software development projects. This system enables efficient context management, session-to-session continuity, and continuous project improvement through structured documentation.

## Features

- **Self-Improving Documentation**: Documentation that evolves and improves as the project progresses
- **Context Management**: Efficiently manages GPT context size to maximize productivity
- **Session Continuity**: Enables GPT to pick up where it left off in new sessions
- **Automated Documentation**: Supports README and commit message generation
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Preserves technical discoveries and implementation decisions
- **Task Management**: Structured approach to breaking down and tracking tasks
- **Version Control Integration**: Documentation-code synchronization strategies

## File Structure

The documentation system consists of three interconnected categories:

### Category A: Project Knowledge Base

- **Project_and_Technical.md**: Central repository of project-specific technical knowledge
- **Template_Guide.md**: Guide for creating and maintaining project knowledge documents

### Category B: GPT Model Configuration

- **{$Project_Description}_Project_Model_Config.md**: Project-specific GPT configuration
- **Copilot_Agent_Default.md**: Base configuration and initialization settings
- **GPT_Config.md**: Technical details of GPT capabilities and limitations

### Category C: Project and Tracking

- **Comprehensive_Project_Technical_Style_Reference.md**: Master reference for the documentation system
- **breakdown_and_tracking.md**: Track project progress and maintain session continuity
- **README.md** and **CHANGELOG.md**: Public documentation and version history

## Getting Started

1. Copy this repository structure into your project
2. Initialize a new project:
   ```
   1. Update Project_and_Technical.md with your project details
   2. Create initial breakdown_and_tracking.md with your first tasks
   3. Initialize {$Project_Description}_Project_Model_Config.md with project-specific configuration
   ```
3. Begin your first GPT session with:
   ```
   Please initialize as a GitHub Copilot agent using the guides in this project.
   Start by reviewing Comprehensive_Project_Technical_Style_Reference.md to understand
   the project structure and technical requirements.
   ```

## Usage

### Common Commands

- `status`: Check current project status
- `next`: Move to next task
- `learn [discovery]`: Document a new technical discovery
- `decision [topic]`: Record a new technical decision
- `readme`: Update the README.md with latest project information

### Session Workflow

1. **Session Start**: GPT loads context from documentation
2. **Task Execution**: Complete tasks while documenting progress
3. **Session End**: Update documentation and plan next steps

## Documentation Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Initialize documentation structure
2. **Evolution**: Continuously update as the project progresses
3. **Refinement**: Consolidate and improve documentation
4. **Application**: Apply documented knowledge to new tasks

## Contributing

1. Use the documentation system in your projects
2. Contribute improvements to templates and processes
3. Share successful patterns and workflows
